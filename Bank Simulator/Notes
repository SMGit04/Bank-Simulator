      
         The "Contract" I sigh with the client, in this case, the POS machine is whether the transaction is approved on not
         Based on the information that the POS machine sends me, I will either approve or decline the transaction
         I should should check if the user has enough money in his account to make the transaction among other things
         We should check the CVV number, the PIN number, the expiry date, the card number, the account number, the account balance against the database
         - If all the information is correct, we should approve the transaction
       
         We should structure the system such that, only when the user approves the tranaction on their mobile phone, the card information 
         is sent to the bank for approval. This is to prevent fraud.
